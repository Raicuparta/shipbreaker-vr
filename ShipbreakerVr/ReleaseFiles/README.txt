Extract the contents of this zip to the game folder.
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hardspace Shipbreaker

That means winhttp.dll will be in the same folder as Shipbreaker.exe.

If you already have other BepInEx mods, you can just tell Windows to not replace any files when prompted.

Start the game as usual. Press F3 to toggle between VR mode and flat mode. I recommend doing it only when in-game, otherwise you might be unable to use the menus.

Press F5 to enable ultra low quality mode. This is lower than what the game normally allows you to pick.

Press F6 to disable all lights in the current scene. Looks sad but can give you a performance boost.
